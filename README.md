My first GenAI project :)
<br/>
This project aims to discover the concepts surrounding the pre-trained LLMs as a part of my learning track with <a href="https://coursera.org/share/ce9b14669661dabbb26a990b80e81a13">DeepLearning.ai's course, Generative AI with Large Language Models</a>.
<br/>

<h2>Updations</h2>
The notebook module imports when followed in the same order, help in successful download of the rouge_score module, which poses UTF-8 encoding and dependency problems with the current Python 3.10 version.

<br/>
Note: I have done the entire implementation in Google Colab, as against the advised cloud resources for better compute resources to train the LLMs. Hence, the results have a huge scope for improvisation when trained for longer duration with GPUs of higher RAM and the whole dataset instead of subsampling.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
Dataset imported in this project can be found at - https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum

<br/>
GenAI is fun. Time to dive into LangChain and other Seq2SeqLM fine-tuning.
